# Monitoring

## Customer

- Customers will have access to a comprehensive **Activity Monitoring Dashboard** provided by **Service Portal**, which allows them to track and analyze activities across all models in real time and includes the metrics provided (coin and token usage metrics). This ensures transparency and helps customers monitor usage effectively. Additionally, alerting system will provide a warning for customers when usage reaches certain thresholds.

## Internal Purpose

- For internal purposes, **LiteLLM** employs **Elasticsearch (langfuse)** additional point 2 to monitor the performance and activities of all deployed models. This system provides real-time insights into operational metrics and allows for quick identification and resolution of issues.
